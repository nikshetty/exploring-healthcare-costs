Exploring Healthcare Costs
-----------------------

In this project, I have analyzed summary Medicare payment data for the top 100 DRGs from 2011. The data is available [here](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3) at the CMS website.

#### What is CMS?
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the **Medicare program** and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.

#### What is a DRG?
A Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is a statistical system of classifying any hospital hospital/inpatient stay into groups in order to facilitate payment of services. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivides them into almost 500 groups for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement. Each DRG is expected  to have similar hospital resource use and hence comparable charges/payments.

#### Severity Tiers in DRGs
DRGs can have following Severity Tiers based on increasing complexity and cost of care and higher payments:
* DRG without CC or MCC
* DRG with CC (complication or comorbidity)
* DRG with MCC (major complication or comorbidity)
For example, Heart Failure & Shock has the following three DRGs:
* 293 - HEART FAILURE & SHOCK W/O CC/MCC
* 292 - HEART FAILURE & SHOCK W CC
* 291 - HEART FAILURE & SHOCK W MCC

#### About The Data
**Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011**
The data includes hospital-specific charges for the more than **3,000 U.S. hospitals** that receive Medicare IPPS payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent more than **7 million discharges** or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges.

#### My Objective
* variation in charges for DRGs across states
* variation in payments for DRGs across states
* variation in overcharge (gap between charges and payments) for DRGs across states
