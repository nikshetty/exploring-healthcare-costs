Exploring US Healthcare Costs
-----------------------

In this project, I will be analyzing summary Medicare payment data for the top 100 DRGs from 2011. The data is available [here](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3) at the CMS website.

#### What is CMS?
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the **Medicare program** and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards.

#### What is a DRG?
A Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is a statistical system of classifying any hospital hospital/inpatient stay into groups in order to facilitate payment of services. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivides them into almost 500 groups for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement. Each DRG is expected  to have similar hospital resource use and hence comparable charges/payments.

#### What does the  dataset contain?
**Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011**
The data include hospital-specific charges for the more than **3,000 U.S. hospitals** that receive Medicare IPPS payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent more than **7 million discharges** or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges.

I will be looking to understand:
* discrepancy between charges and payments at the state level
* discrepancy between charges and payments at DRG level
